      <p>
        Kumaran Systems was founded by a team of passionate individuals 30 years
        ago, fuelled by their vision and determination to create a better future
        through technology. Shortly after its inception, Kumaran Systems has
        positioned itself as one of the most sought-after technology companies
        over the world through our legendary product ‘Forms*Converter’ which
        eases Oracle Forms Migration. We started as a product development
        company and eventually extended our wings to legacy migrations, and now
        we have transcended into a Technology Company that houses competences
        for a large spectrum of IT practices. Kumaran Systems is one of the few
        companies that has witnessed the IT revolution in the information era
        and has grown along with it thereby combining experiences and also
        understanding its intricate nuances.
